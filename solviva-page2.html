            <ul style="margin:0 0 15px 0px; padding:0; list-style-position: inside;">
                <li>Coverage: Our warranty covers manufacturing defects. Please note that it doesn’t cover damage from normal wear and tear, unauthorized modifications, or events beyond our control, such as natural disasters.</li>
                <li>Warranty Claims: If you experience any issues, please notify us in writing within 30 days of identifying the defect. We are committed to reviewing your claim and resolving the issue as promptly as possible.</li>
                <li>Preventive Maintenance: Failure to conduct proper and periodic Preventive Maintenance activities may void the warranty.</li>

            <li>Down Payment: Should you need to cancel after making the down payment, we will refund 80% of it, provided no materials have been ordered. If materials have already been procured, we may need to retain the payment to cover those costs.</li>
            <li>Should Solviva not be able to proceed with the completion of the installation and consequent turnover of the Solar Facility due to an action or decision of the client such as, but not limited to, the unavailability of the structure on which the Solar Facility will be installed, then Solviva shall turn over any and all installed portions of the facility, and the client shall be liable for the payments commensurate to the portions that have been turned over.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Quotation Validity -->
            <h3 style="font-size:11px; margin:20px 0 0px 0; font-weight:bold;">Quotation Validity</h3>
            <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">The special quotation we’ve provided is valid for thirty (30) days from the date it was issued. We’re committed to being transparent about pricing and will inform you of any necessary adjustments as soon as possible.</p>

            <!-- Price Adjustments -->
            <h3 style="font-size:11px; margin:20px 0 0px 0; font-weight:bold;">Price Adjustments</h3>
            <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">Please be aware that prices may change due to factors beyond our control, like fluctuations in material costs. We’ll always keep you informed and discuss any necessary adjustments.</p>

            <!-- Default in Payments -->
            <h3 style="font-size:11px; margin:20px 0 0px 0; font-weight:bold;">Default in Payments</h3>
            <p style="margin:0 0 10px 0;"><strong>Late Payments:</strong> We understand that things can happen, but we do need to charge a 3% monthly interest on any overdue payments. If you’re having trouble making a payment, please reach out to us so we can find a solution together.</p>

            <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;"><strong>Legal Action:</strong> In the rare event that payments remain unsettled, we may need to take legal steps to recover the amount due, including interest and any associated costs. We prefer to resolve matters amicably and hope this will never be necessary.</p>

            <!-- Labor Costs -->
            <h3 style="font-size:11px; margin:20px 0 0px 0; font-weight:bold;">Labor Costs</h3>

            <li><strong>Inclusions:</strong> Labor costs are included in our quotation unless pre-existing wiring or systems are found that require additional work. We will assess the site during the visit and inform you of any potential extra costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Additional Costs:</strong> If additional costs arise, we will notify you right away and proceed only with your written consent. We believe in full transparency, so there will be no surprises.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Payment Obligation -->
            <h3 style="font-size:11px; margin:20px 0 0px 0; font-weight:bold;">Payment Obligation</h3>

            <p style="margin:0 0 15px 0;">Your satisfaction is our priority, and we will manage the entire process diligently from start to finish.</p>

            <p style="margin:0 0 15px 0;">Any additional materials required to install the solar facility shall be subject to another order form. Should Solviva not be able to proceed with the completion of the installation, and the consequent turnover of the Solar Facility due to an action or decision of the client such as, but not limited to, the unavailability of the structure on which the Solar Facility will be installed, then Solviva shall turn over any and all installed portions of the facility, and the client shall be liable for the payments commensurate to the portions that have been turned over. Any additional materials required to install the solar facility shall be subject to another order form.</p>

            <p style="margin:0;">We appreciate your understanding that the net metering status does not impact the payment terms outlined in this proposal. Thank you for choosing Solviva. We look forward to helping you make the switch to clean, renewable energy.</p>
